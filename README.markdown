# Vector Crumbs
Vector Crumbs is an easy way to do 2 things:  
1. drag & drop with a Raphael set  
2. draw shapes behind your dragged object.  

## The problem I'm trying to solve
While I love Raphael's drag & drop, I don't like having to write the same boilerplate code everytime I want to drag something.

I also wanted something that triggered events as the dragging occured.

## Here's a tentative roadmap ##
* 1.2: add variable width 
* 1.3: post drag smoothing
* 1.4: add solid/dashed crumb type
* 1.5: add ability to crumb static Raphael objects insted of simple dashes
* 1.6: add Raphael objects that have animations
